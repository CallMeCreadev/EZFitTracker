This Android app tracks your exercise, calorie consumption, and weight. The calorie feature allows you to enter an item by name and later update the item's calories. The next time you enter an item of the same name it will be assigned that calorie count. When Updating the calories of an item you can choose to update all items of the same name. You can use the reports feature to see how your daily averages compare to the week or month prior. You can enter your daily steps as exercise and it will be converted into exercise minutes (100 steps = 1 minute). The charts feature will create a visual representation of progress over the last 30 days
